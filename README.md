## The challenge

The running tracker is an inspiration of this [course's project](https://fun-javascript-projects.com/) to put in practise some JavaScript concepts while having fun!
I have customised my own design, went through every concept that was new for me, researched about it to get a deeper understanding and rebuilt this project over and over again till I understand everything completely.

### What I learned

JavaScript concepts to learn and practise:

- Arrays and arrays methods like reduce(), push()

Be creative, make mistakes, learn and have fun! ðŸš€
